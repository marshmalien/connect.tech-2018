#### What's the big deal? Getting started with styled-components.
##### Steve Pietrek
ReactJS has quickly become a front-end developer favorite for creating web applications. One of the key features is its component-focused approach for building applications. A new paradigm, CSS-in-JS was created, to help improve developer experience when developing component-based applications. In this session, we’ll start by discussing component-based design and how it differs from traditional design. We will move to discussing CSS-in-JS and benefits it provides when building component-based applications. Finally, we will cover one of the more popular CSS-in-JS libraries for ReactJS, styled-components. This talk will enable attendees to start using styled-components in their own ReactJS application.
